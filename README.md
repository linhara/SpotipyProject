# SpotipyProject
We have created a web application using spotify API. The purpose of the project is for people to see if they are basic or not depending on which songs they have in their playlists. The user writes their spotify username on the website and become redirected to spotify to log in. We are then given an access token which alows us to log compare their songs population with the average population. If a user is basic, they will be redirected to a new "sad" website which logs the result infront of them. On the other hand, if a user is not basic, they will be redirected to a "happy" website where the result will be displayed on the screen.
