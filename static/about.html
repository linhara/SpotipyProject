A lot o people tend to let trends and social media control their taste in music. Such a person is, in medical term, defined as a 'basic bitch'. A basic bitch is someone who only listenes to the top songs, the songs that have the most listeners. Since this is a world wide problem which could affect our children, we have created a website to check if you are a 'basic bitch'. Our webb applicaton will save countless people from not having any personality traits and save our planet. We have created the basic bitch application to save you, nay, the humanity.
